Stress is a common aspect of everyday life that affects most people at various times. However, experiencing long-term or high levels of stress can compromise safety and disrupt daily routines. Early detection of mental stress can prevent many associated health problems. When a person becomes stressed, there are noticeable shifts in HRV signals that can be captured by PPG sensors. This enables individuals to gain crucial health insights and take proactive steps to effectively manage stress. Several machine learning techniques for stress detection, using data from the WESAD dataset, are proposed. The accuracies of Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Gradient Boosting Classifier models are compared. The goal is to innovate stress management techniques, fostering happier, healthier, and more resilient individuals and communities. Integrating this solution into smartwatches offers potential for future advancements, providing real-time feedback on stress levels and empowering individuals to enhance their overall well-being proactively.
